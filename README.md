# Built-Up Growth Rapid Assessment Geoprocessing Tool
This script is intended to run with .atbx file as an custom geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro.
I included custom colormap, but you need to set the path to absolute path in your computer. I doesnt know why but it won't work with relative path.

This script uses NDBI, MNDWI, and modified Index-Based Builtup Index (mIBI) that I personally developed after some intensive research (three weeks *cough *cough).
So yeah, the methods are not scientificly proven (yet). But based on my internal testing, it achieves 85-92% of OA on three urban agglomeration area.
Basically, this is for fun experiment and learning purpose~

Anyway, you can use it for anything as long as it's not commercial (non-profit) and credited me.
